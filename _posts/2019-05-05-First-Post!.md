Ahh finally! My first post is LIVE now…

If you are a blogger, you might know writing your first post is one of the most difficult task to do. You would be amazed to know that it’s around 7 months when I designed this blog but every time I think of writing I find myself in that forbidden region where I couldn’t excite myself to finally publish my post.

So, let me introduce myself, I am **Shashi Kant** (although it's clearly evident from my blog name, there are some formalities you must do :-P), an undergrad at Department of Electrical Engineering, **IIT Kanpur** (IITK). I just came out of fighting my sixth semester, I really hate examinations and I am not someone from whom you can seek to find exam tips, I do terrible things/ blunders in my exams (maybe sometime I will share them). But I can bet, you will find me really talented when it comes to doing real things out there! Hey, don’t go on my words, I still have a decent GPA :-P, which I can probably boast about around many of my batch mates :-P. Ah let me boast a little about myself, as evident from my college, I cleared one of the toughest exams in India, **JEE Adv** to finally land here at IIT Kanpur. I spent my second-year summer as a Student Intern at **SUTD Singapore** and this summer I will be going to **Harvard Medical School, USA** (HMS). How come Electrical Engineering and Harvard Medical School??? Well although I am in the Electrical Engineering department, I decided on to move for higher studies in **Cognitive Sciences** and presently I'm also a minor student in the Cognitive Science Department @IITK. And I will be working on **Computational Neuroscience** and **Artifical Intelligence** @HMS.

The motivation behind this blog is to share some of the experiences and problems which I faced while in my college which may be useful to some of you, especially to my junior undergrads @IITK. Also, I will be writing about my research works and some random things as well! I hope most of you will find it an interesting read. Some of the stories with which I will be coming up in a few days are:

* Goods and bads which I did in my first year
* Ragging at IITK (is that ragging at all?)
* When and why I decided to switch my stream
* Introducing Humanoid IITK, where it all began
* My SUTD Singapore internship story
* How peer pressure is shaping our choices
* And many more.......
